#  How to Play Casino Royale in Lenz

Casino Royale is a popular card game that can be played with 3 to 5 players. The goal of the game is to collect as many poker points as possible, with the winning player being the one with the most points at the end of the game. Casino Royale can be played with a regular deck of 52 cards, or with a special Casino Royale deck which contains two jokers.

The dealer begins the game by dealing five cards to each player, and then places one card face up in the middle of the table. The player to the dealer's left starts play by drawing one card from the deck and discarding one card, then play moves clockwise around the table. When a player discards a joker, they must place it face up in front of them and take another turn.

The following are the rules for playing Casino Royale:

-A player must place a bet prior to taking their turn. The bet must be at least equal to twice the value of the previous bet, or else it is forfeited.

-When playing a card, the rank of the card is important, not its suit. The Ace is high (A-K-Q-J-10) and the Two is low (2-3-4-5-6).

-If two or more players have equal points at the end of a hand, then the player with more spades in their hand wins. If there is still a tie, then compare suits (clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades), and finally compare individual cards to break any remaining ties.
