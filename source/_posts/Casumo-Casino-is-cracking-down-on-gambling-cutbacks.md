#  Casumo Casino is cracking down on gambling cutbacks

Casumo Casino, one of the world’s most popular online casinos, is cracking down on spending in order to mitigate the effects of gambling cutbacks. The casino has announced plans to significantly reduce the amount of money that players can withdraw from their accounts each month.

Previously, players were able to withdraw up to €5,000 per month. However, this limit will now be reduced to just €1,000. In a statement released by the casino, it was explained that “this is an important step for us in order to manage our costs in these challenging times.”

The decision has been met with mixed reactions from players. Some feel that the new limit is too restrictive and will severely restrict their ability to play at the casino. Others appreciate Casumo Casino’s efforts to manage costs during these tough times and feel that the new limit is reasonable.

Casumo Casino is not the only online casino to reduce withdrawals in response to gambling cutbacks. In January, Mr Green announced plans to restrict player withdrawals to just £2,000 per month. Coral also reduced its monthly withdrawal limit from £5,000 to £2,000 earlier this year.

These restrictions are likely to be short-lived, however. With the gambling industry starting to recover from the recent recession, it is likely that we will see withdrawal limits return to their previous levels in the near future.

#  Casumo Casino announces new measures for responsible gambling

Casumo Casino, one of the leading online casinos in the world, has announced new measures to promote responsible gambling. The casino has long been a leader in promoting responsible gambling, and these latest measures are designed to further ensure that players have a safe and enjoyable experience when playing at Casumo Casino.

Some of the new measures include increasing the maximum bet limit, implementing time restrictions on games, and restricting access to casino games for players who have shown signs of problem gambling. In addition, the casino will be working more closely with organisations such as GamCare to provide support for players who may be experiencing difficulties with their gambling.

Casumo Casino’s Head of Gaming, Jonas Antonsson, spoke about the new measures, saying “At Casumo Casino we are committed to promoting responsible gambling and ensuring that our players have a safe and enjoyable experience when playing our games. These new measures are designed to further support this commitment, and we will be working closely with organisations such as GamCare to provide support for players who may need it.”

GamCare is a UK-based organisation that provides support for people with gambling problems. It offers counselling, advice, and information on how to get help.

These latest measures come after research by the UK Gambling Commission showed that problem gambling rates in the UK had increased from 0.7% in 2012/13 to 1.5% in 2016/17. This increase is attributed to increased availability of online gambling options.

The UK Gambling Commission has since released guidance for operators on how to promote responsible gambling and protect vulnerable players. This guidance includes recommendations such as implementing time restrictions on games, setting bet limits, and providing player tracking and management tools.

#  Casumo Casino introduces cutbacks to help players gamble responsibly
Casumo Casino is a popular online casino that has seen a surge in popularity in recent years. However, the casino has announced that it will be making some changes to its operation in order to help players gamble responsibly.

The main change that Casumo Casino is making is that it will be reducing the maximum bet size for its games. This means that players will no longer be able to bet more than €5 per spin on slots and other games. The casino says that this change is being made in order to ensure that players don't lose too much money if they start gambling irresponsibly.

Casumo Casino is also introducing a number of measures to help players keep track of their spending. These include a spending limit feature, which will allow players to set a limit on how much money they can spend in a day, week or month. Players will also be able to track their progress towards meeting their responsible gambling goals.

Casumo Casino's Head of PR, Andres Högström, said "We are always looking for ways to improve our service and make sure our players have the best possible experience. These new measures are designed to help our players gamble responsibly, and we hope that they will be beneficial for both the player and the casino."

#  Casumo Casino announces new commitment to responsible gambling

Casumo Casino, one of the world's leading online casinos, today announced a new commitment to responsible gambling. The move comes as the company launches its new Responsible Gambling Ambassador programme, which will see Casumo work with organisations including GambleAware and the Responsible Gambling Trust (RGT) to help promote responsible gambling practices.

"At Casumo, we take our responsibility to players very seriously," said CEO Oscar Simonsson. "We want to ensure that everyone who enjoys our games does so in a safe and responsible manner. Our new Responsible Gambling Ambassador programme is designed to help us achieve that goal, and we're delighted to be working with GambleAware and the RGT as part of it."

Under the programme, Casumo will work with GambleAware and the RGT to provide information and training on responsible gambling practices to its employees, customers and other stakeholders. In addition, Casumo will support initiatives such as GambleAware's SMART campaign and the RGT's BeGambleAware.org website.

"We're really pleased to be working with Casumo on this important initiative," said Marc Etches, CEO of GambleAware. " They are a leader in the industry when it comes to promoting responsible gambling practices, and we look forward to collaborating with them to further reduce the risk of harm from gambling."

"We're excited about this new partnership with Casumo," said Isobel Thomas, Director of Corporate Affairs at the RGT. " Their commitment to promoting responsible gambling is exemplary, and we look forward to working together to help people gamble responsibly."

#  Casumo Casino positions itself as a responsible gambling advocate

Casumo Casino, a Malta-licensed online casino, is positioning itself as a responsible gambling advocate. The company announced this week the launch of its new Responsible Gambling Programme, which is aimed at helping players gamble responsibly.

"Our Responsible Gambling Programme has been designed to provide our players with all the necessary tools and information required to gamble responsibly," said Astrid Nilsen, Casumo Casino's Chief Operating Officer. "It is our hope that through this programme we can help protect our players from the dangers associated with problem gambling and encourage them to enjoy our games in a safe and responsible manner."

To that end, the programme features a variety of resources for players, including self-exclusion options, gameplay limits, and personalised advice from trained counsellors. Players can also set up deposit limits to help them stay within their budget. In addition, Casumo Casino has partnered with GamCare, a leading UK-based charity that provides support for people affected by problem gambling.

"We are delighted to be working with Casumo Casino as they launch their Responsible Gambling Programme," said GamCare CEO Richard Watson. "This partnership will help us reach more people impacted by problem gambling and provide them with the support they need."

Casumo Casino is not the only online casino advocating responsible gambling practices; several other operators have launched similar programmes in recent months. But what sets Casumo Casino apart is its focus on player education. The company has created an extensive range of resources that cover everything from how to spot signs of problem gambling to how to set appropriate limits on your gaming behaviour.

"Responsible gambling should be something that is taken seriously by everyone involved in the industry — operators, regulators, and especially players themselves," said Nilsen. "We believe that our Responsible Gambling Programme will go a long way in helping us foster a responsible gaming environment at Casumo Casino."
