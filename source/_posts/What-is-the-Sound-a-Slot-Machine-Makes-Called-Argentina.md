#  What is the Sound a Slot Machine Makes Called Argentina?

A slot machine (American English), known variously as a fruit machine (British English), puggy (Scottish English), the gaming machine (Australian English), or simply slot (American English), is a gambling device used to bet on the results of a spinning wheel.

Typically, a slot machine contains three or more reels which spin when a button is pushed. Slot machines are also known as one-armed bandits because they were originally operated by one lever on the side of the machine, as distinct from a button on the front panel.

In many jurisdictions, slots are regulated by law and are considered a form of gambling. Many American states have legalized gambling on slot machines, although this is prohibited in other countries. 

Slot machines include a currency detector that validates the money inserted to play. The machine pays off according to patterns of symbols appearing on its display when it stops rotating after being activated by the player.
