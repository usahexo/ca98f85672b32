#  Relief In Sight For Cripple Creek Gambling Sufferers

Casino gambling in Cripple Creek, Colorado, may soon become more accessible for people with disabilities, as the town’s casino operators have pledged to make their venues more accommodating.

Colorado Casino Enterprises (CCE), which operates three casinos in Cripple Creek, recently announced that it will be making a number of changes to its facilities in order to make them more accessible for people with disabilities. This includes installing wheelchair ramps and elevators, as well as adding Braille signage and hearing loops.

The decision was spurred on by a recent change in Colorado law that requires all casinos to make “reasonable accommodations” for people with disabilities. While CCE had been making some accommodations already, the new law prompted the company to go further and make a concerted effort to make its casinos fully accessible.

This is great news for people with disabilities who enjoy gambling, as it will allow them to do so in an environment that is more suited to their needs. It also sets a good example for other casinos across the country, many of which are still not fully accessible for those with disabilities.

#  A Win-Win Situation For Cripple Creek Casino Goers



Casino-goers in Cripple Creek can now enjoy their favorite gambling pastime while having a new place to stay. The Imperial Palace has recently announced plans to open a hotel on its property, which is great news for both the casino and its patrons.

The new hotel will be a welcome addition to the area. There are currently no other hotels within walking distance of the casino, so this will give players a place to stay without having to worry about finding transportation. Plus, the hotel will be able to accommodate large groups, which is something that is often difficult to find in this area.

The Imperial Palace has been working on this project for some time and is finally ready to open its doors. The hotel will have 83 rooms, all of which include a mini-fridge and microwave. It will also offer guests a complimentary breakfast each morning as well as an outdoor pool and spa.

This new development is sure to bring even more people to Cripple Creek. In fact, business owners in the area are already reporting an increase in traffic. The Imperial Palace is excited about the added revenue this new venture will bring in and looks forward to welcoming guests from near and far.
