I was a little hesitant to try out Inferno Deluxe at first. I'm not usually one for games that are too dark or violent, but I'm glad I gave it a try. The game is anything but dark and violent - in fact, it's quite the opposite.

Inferno Deluxe has quickly become one of my favorite games. It's so much fun to explore the different worlds and meet the strange creatures that live there. I never know what to expect around each corner, and that's part of what makes the game so exciting.

I've also been impressed by the quality of the graphics and audio in Inferno Deluxe. The game is truly beautiful, and the music adds a lot to the overall experience.
