In any casino game, the house has an advantage. In blackjack, that advantage is usually around 1 percent. But professional blackjack players use strategy and card counting to reduce the house edge to as low as 0.5 percent. 

There are a few basic tenets of blackjack strategy that all players should follow:

-Never split 10s or 5s.
-Split 8s and Aces.
-Double down on 11 if the dealer shows a 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
-Double down on 10 if the dealer shows a 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
-Hit on anything other than a hard 12 through 16.

These basic concepts can help you reduce the house edge and increase your chances of winning at blackjack.
