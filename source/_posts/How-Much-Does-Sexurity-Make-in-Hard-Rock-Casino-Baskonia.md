#  How Much Does Sexurity Make in Hard Rock Casino Baskonia?

In this article, we take a look at how much Sexurity makes in the Hard Rock Casino Baskonia.

First of all, it's important to understand what Sexurity is. Simply put, it's a type of game that is played using cards. In Sexurity, players compete to create the best possible five-card poker hand. The player who creates the best hand wins the pot.

Now that we know what Sexurity is, let's take a look at how much money can be made playing it in the Hard Rock Casino Baskonia.

The basic rules of Sexurity are as follows:

Each player is dealt two cards face down. The player with the highest value card starts the bidding process by bidding or passing. If all players pass, the highest value card on the table is turned over and becomes the first card in the community pile. The second card in each player's hand is also turned over and becomes part of the community pile. 
After the first round of bidding, each player is dealt one more card face up, followed by another round of bidding. 
The highest ranking five-card poker hand takes the pot.

The minimum bet at a Sexurity table in Hard Rock Casino Baskonia is €0.10/$0.15 and goes up to €10/$15 per hand. So, if you're playing at a €10/$15 table and you're dealt two Aces (the highest rank), your opponent would have to bid €40/$60 to stay in the hand. If they don't have enough money to cover this bet, they will automatically lose and you will win their chips!
At a €10/$15 table, therefore, you could potentially make €350/$525 per hour just by playing Sexurity!
