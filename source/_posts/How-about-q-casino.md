#  Why did Indianapolis Colts fire Chuck Pagano?

The Indianapolis Colts abruptly fired head coach Chuck Pagano on Sunday, less than 24 hours after the team's season-ending loss to the Houston Texans. This move comes as a bit of a surprise, as Pagano was coming off of his best season with the Colts and appeared to be in good standing with the team.

So why did the Colts fire Pagano? There are a few possible reasons.

One possibility is that new general manager Chris Ballard simply wanted to make a fresh start and bring in his own coach. Ballard took over as general manager in January, and it's possible that he wants to put his own stamp on the team.

Another possibility is that Pagano and Ballard had a personality clash and Ballard decided that it was better to cut ties with Pagano than try to work through their differences.

It's also possible that there were off-the-field issues that led to Pagano's dismissal. For example, it's been rumored that quarterback Andrew Luck may have been unhappy with Pagano's coaching style.

Whatever the reason for Pagano's firing, it will be interesting to see who the Colts hire as their next head coach.

#  Who will be the new head coach of the Indianapolis Colts?

The Indianapolis Colts are currently looking for a new head coach after the firing of Chuck Pagano. There are a few top candidates rumored to be in the running, including New England Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels and Philadelphia Eagles defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz.

Josh McDaniels is the clear front runner for the job, as he has already met with Colts owner Jim Irsay. He is highly respected in the NFL and has a lot of experience as an offensive coordinator. He would be a good choice for the Colts, as he could help quarterback Andrew Luck revive his career.

Jim Schwartz is also a strong candidate for the job. He has been a successful defensive coordinator for several teams and knows how to win games. He would likely bring a more aggressive style to the Colts defense, which could lead to more wins next season.

Whoever ends up being the new head coach of the Indianapolis Colts, they will have their work cut out for them. The team has struggled in recent years and needs to improve their record if they want to make it back to the playoffs.
