      		<h1 id="Dolores-Del-Rio-The-Ultimate-Slot-Machine-Play"><a href="#Dolores-Del-Rio-The-Ultimate-Slot-Machine-Play" class="headerlink" title="Dolores Del Rio: The Ultimate Slot Machine Play!"></a>Dolores Del Rio: The Ultimate Slot Machine Play!</h1><p>Dolores del Rio was one of the most popular actresses in Hollywood during the 1920s and 1930s. She was also one of the first celebrities to endorse slot machines. Del Rio starred in many popular films during her career, including Flying Down to Rio, The Littlest Rebel, Bird of Paradise, and Ramona. She was known for her beautiful features and her charismatic personality.</p>
<p>Del Rio was born on October 3, 1905, in Durango, Mexico. Her parents were both opera singers, and she grew up traveling throughout Mexico and Europe. She made her stage debut at the age of six and later studied drama in New York City. In 1924, she moved to Hollywood and quickly became a star.</p>
<p>Del Rio married several times over the course of her life. Her first husband was director Rouben Mamoulian, whom she met while filming Flying Down to Rio. They were married from 1929 to 1933 and had one son together. Del Rio later married actor Doug Fairbanks Jr., which ended in divorce in 1938. Her third husband was actor Joseph Schildkraut, which ended in divorce in 1945. Del Rio’s fourth and final husband was orchestra conductor Jaime Mendoza-Nava; they remained married until her death in 1983.</p>
<p>Throughout her career, Del Rio starred in dozens of popular films. Some of her most famous roles include Cleopatra in The Littlest Rebel (1935), Patsy O’Brien in Bird of Paradise (1932), Linda Lee Thomas in Ramona (1936), and Consuelo Montoya in The Flame and the Arrow (1950). She also appeared on Broadway several times and won a Tony Award for her performance in The Star-Spangled Girl (1966).</p>
<p>In addition to acting, Del Rio also performed as a singer and dancer. She often sang Mexican folk songs or popular show tunes from her films. Her dancing skills were also highly praised; she once said, “I have always considered dance the best form of expression ever invented by man.”</p>
<p>Del Rio retired from acting in 1967 but continued to make occasional appearances on television until her death in 1983. During her lifetime, she received numerous awards and honors, including an Oscar nomination for Best Actress (1934), a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy (1966), and a Tony Award for Best Actress – Play (1966). She was also inducted into the American Film Institute’s Hall of Fame in 1974.</p>
<p>Slot machine manufacturers saw an opportunity to market their products to movie fans when they noticed that many celebrities were endorsing slot machines. One of the earliest celebrities to endorse a slot machine was Dolores del Rio. In 1930, just two years after she made her Hollywood debut, del Rio became the official spokeswoman for Mills Novelty Company’s “Dolores Deluxe” slot machine.</p>
<p>The “Dolores Deluxe” slot machine was a huge success; over 100,000 units were sold between 1930 and 1931 alone! In fact, it became so popular that other celebrities began endorsing their own slot machines shortly thereafter. These early celebrity endorsements helped boost sales for slot machine manufacturers and solidified their place as a major form of gambling entertainment nationwide</p>
