Her exotic beauty and fiery temperament captivated audiences everywhere, including in Russia. When del Rio visited Moscow in 1922, she met a group of Russian aristocrats who were fascinated by her. The group became known as the “Del Rio Circle” and they would often gather together to play a game called Russian roulette.</p>
<p>Russian roulette is a deadly game where players take turns spinning a revolver cylinder with one bullet and place the muzzle against their head before pulling the trigger. It is said that del Rio was so taken with the game that she started playing it herself. Some even claim that she invented it. While there is no evidence to support this claim, it’s certainly possible that she inspired the invention of Russian roulette.</p>
<p>Del Rio’s fans were entranced by her dangerous games, and many began to emulate her behavior. It wasn’t long before Russian roulette became a popular pastime among Russians of all social classes. In fact, the game was so widespread that it even spawned its own slang term – podkurit (to smoke), which referred to the sound of the gunshot.</p>
<p>Russian roulette quickly became synonymous with danger and intrigue, and it continues to be popular today. While del Rio may not have actually invented Russian roulette, her influence helped make it one of the most infamous games in history.</p>
<h1 id="Dolores-Del-Rio’s-Life-Inspires-The-Creation-Of-Russian-Roulette"><a href="#Dolores-Del-Rio’s-Life-Inspires-The-Creation-Of-Russian-Roulette" class="headerlink" title="Dolores Del Rio’s Life Inspires The Creation Of Russian Roulette"></a>Dolores Del Rio’s Life Inspires The Creation Of Russian Roulette</h1><p> Mexican-born actress Dolores del Rio (1902-1983) was a major Hollywood star in the 1920s and 1930s. Her life story is the inspiration for Russian Roulette, a new play by David Ives that had its world premiere at the Philly Theater Company on October 9, 2017.</p>
<p>Del Rio was born in Durango, Mexico, on August 3, 1902. She was the daughter of Manuela “Nati” Medrano and Pedro “Perfecto” del Rio y González, a wealthy landowner and horse breeder. When she was four years old, her family moved to Los Angeles. After completing high school, del Rio studied acting with theater pioneer Sid Grauman.</p>
<p>In 1922, she made her movie debut in The Loves of Pharaoh. She went on to star in such films as Sensations of 1923 (her first talkie), Sadie Thompson (1928), Flying Down to Rio (1933), and The Night Is Young (1935). She also appeared on Broadway, winning a Tony Award for her performance in 1945’s The Red Mill.</p>
<p>In 1937, del Rio starred in San Francisco opposite Spencer Tracy. While filming a love scene for the movie, Tracy got carried away and slapped her across the face—hard. Del Rio later recalled: “He hit me so hard I thought he’d killed me. I ran off the set screaming and crying.” The two never worked together again.</p>
<p>In 1941, del Rio married actor Cedric Gibbons (designer of the Oscar statuette), but they divorced after only three years. In 1946, she married Mexican bullfighter Jorge Negrete, but he died of cancer just four years later. In 1969, she married Dr. Clifford Allen, with whom she remained until his death in 1983.</p>
<p>Throughout her life, del Rio battled health problems caused by syphilis (which she contracted as a young woman). In 1972, she underwent brain surgery to remove a tumor; it left her partially paralyzed and unable to speak clearly. She eventually retired from show business and moved back to Mexico City to live with her son Manuel Jr.</p>
<p>Dolores del Rio’s life story is an inspiring one—full of courage and determination in the face of adversity. It’s no wonder that playwright David Ives chose her as the subject for his latest work, Russian Roulette.</p>
<h1 id="How-Dolores-Del-Rio’s-Tragic-Life-Led-To-The-Popularity-Of-Russian-Roulette"><a href="#How-Dolores-Del-Rio’s-Tragic-Life-Led-To-The-Popularity-Of-Russian-Roulette" class="headerlink" title="How Dolores Del Rio’s Tragic Life Led To The Popularity Of Russian Roulette"></a>How Dolores Del Rio’s Tragic Life Led To The Popularity Of Russian Roulette</h1><p>Dolores Del Rio was born on August 3, 1905, in Durango, Mexico. Her father was a banker, and her mother was a socialite. When Dolores was four years old, her family moved to Los Angeles, where she would spend the rest of her childhood and teenage years.</p>
<p>As a young girl, Dolores had a passion for the arts. She loved to sing and dance, and she had a natural talent for both. In 1924, at the age of 19, Dolores traveled to New York City to pursue a career in acting.</p>
<p>She started out small, appearing in minor roles in Broadway productions. But it wasn’t long before she caught the attention of Hollywood executives. In 1927, she signed a contract with Warner Bros. Studios and made her feature film debut in “The Littlest Rebel”.</p>
<p>For the next several years, Dolores starred in a string of popular films including “Christopher Strong” (1933), “Flying Down to Rio” (1933), and “The Gay Divorcee” (1934). She quickly became one of Hollywood’s biggest stars.</p>
<p>In 1935, Dolores met Raul Ybarra, a Mexican writer and actor. The two fell in love and were soon married. They had one son together named Fernando.</p>
<p>In 1937, Dolores starred in what would become her most famous role: that of Lucy Morgan in the film “Rio Grande”. The movie was a huge success, earning critical acclaim and grossing over $2 million at the box office.</p>
<p>Sadly, just as her career was starting to take off, Dolores’ personal life began to unravel. Her marriage to Raul Ybarra was plagued by constant fighting and infidelity on both sides. In 1940, they divorced after four years of marriage.</p>
<p>Dolores then embarked on a series of high-profile relationships with some of Hollywood’s most famous men including Orson Welles and John Wayne. But no matter how hard she tried, she couldn’t seem to find lasting happiness.</p>
<p>In 1951, at the age of 46, Dolores suffered a devastating personal loss when her only son Fernando died suddenly from pneumonia at the age of 21. To make matters worse, later that same year she was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer.</p>
<p>Knowing that she was dying, Dolores decided to return home to Mexico to spend her final days with her family. On April 11th 1952 – just six weeks after being diagnosed – Dolores passed away from cancer at the age of 46.</p>
<p>Her tragic life story has since become the inspiration for the popular game known as Russian roulette which supposedly originated from an incident that took place during World War II involving Ybarra and some American soldiers</p>
<h1 id="Why-Russian-Roulette-Is-Named-After-Dolores-Del-Rio"><a href="#Why-Russian-Roulette-Is-Named-After-Dolores-Del-Rio" class="headerlink" title="Why Russian Roulette Is Named After Dolores Del Rio"></a>Why Russian Roulette Is Named After Dolores Del Rio</h1><p>The game of Russian roulette is named after the actress Dolores del Rio, who reportedly played the game during parties in the 1920s. The story goes that del Rio would put a revolver to her head and pull the trigger with one chamber empty, stunning her guests with her bravado.</p>
<h1 id="The-Fascinating-History-Behind-The-Name-Of-Russian-Roulette"><a href="#The-Fascinating-History-Behind-The-Name-Of-Russian-Roulette" class="headerlink" title="The Fascinating History Behind The Name Of Russian Roulette"></a>The Fascinating History Behind The Name Of Russian Roulette</h1><p>Russian roulette is a lethal game of chance in which a player places a single round in a revolver, spins the cylinder, places the muzzle against their head, and pulls the trigger. If the cartridge is not discharged, they then repeat the process with another chamber.</p>
<p>The origins of Russian roulette are disputed, but some believe that it was developed by Russian soldiers during the Napoleonic Wars. Others claim that it originated in France in the early 1800s. Regardless of its origin, Russian roulette quickly gained notoriety as a deadly game.</p>
<p>In desperation to end their misery, some people have even resorted to playing Russian roulette with live rounds. On July 11th, 1890, American newspaper editor David Graham Phillips attempted suicide by playing Russian roulette with real bullets. He survived, but suffered serious brain damage.</p>
<p>Despite its deadly reputation, Russian roulette continues to be popular to this day. It has been featured in numerous movies and television shows, and remains an iconic symbol of danger and recklessness.</p>
