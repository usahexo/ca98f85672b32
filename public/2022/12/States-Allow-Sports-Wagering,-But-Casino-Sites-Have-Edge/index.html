      		<h1 id="States-Allow-Sports-Wagering-But-Casino-Sites-Have-Edge"><a href="#States-Allow-Sports-Wagering-But-Casino-Sites-Have-Edge" class="headerlink" title="States Allow Sports Wagering, But Casino Sites Have Edge"></a>States Allow Sports Wagering, But Casino Sites Have Edge</h1><p>Now that the U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the way for states to legalize sports betting, the race is on to see who can cash in first.</p>
<p>At least six states — Nevada, Delaware, New Jersey, Mississippi, West Virginia and Pennsylvania — have already introduced bills to allow sports wagering in some form.</p>
<p>But the big money is likely to be made by casino operators, who have a big edge over state lotteries when it comes to setting up betting operations.</p>
<p>Casinos have been gambling on sports for years in Europe and other parts of the world,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> and they are well positioned to do the same in the United States. They have the infrastructure in place, including computers that can quickly process bets and reliable customer service.</p>
<p>State lotteries, by contrast, generally lack those capabilities and would need to partner with casinos or other entities to get up and running quickly.</p>
<p>“The casinos are going to be in a much better position than the lotteries to take advantage of this opportunity because they have existing systems in place that can handle sports betting very effectively and efficiently,” said Stephanie McManus, director of business development for Spectrum Gaming Group, a consulting firm that specializes in the gambling industry.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean state lotteries won’t try to get into the sports betting business. They see it as a way to generate more revenue at a time when traditional sources such as lotteries and casinos are coming under pressure from new forms of gambling such as online poker and fantasy sports.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania is one state where both casinos and state lotteries are expected to pursue sports betting licenses. The state has long had a horse racing industry but has been slow to embrace other forms of legal gambling. That is changing now that Pennsylvania is facing a $2 billion budget deficit.</p>
<p>“There is no question that this will be an important piece of our strategy moving forward as we look for new ways to increase revenue streams for the commonwealth,” said Drew Svitko, vice president of interactive gaming for Penn National Gaming Inc., which operates 34 gaming properties across 18 states.</p>
<h1 id="How-Many-States-Allow-Sports-Wagering-Check-The-Map"><a href="#How-Many-States-Allow-Sports-Wagering-Check-The-Map" class="headerlink" title="How Many States Allow Sports Wagering? Check The Map"></a>How Many States Allow Sports Wagering? Check The Map</h1><p>As of Monday, January 14th, 2019, 33 states have now passed some form of legislation authorizing sports betting. Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey, and West Virginia were the first four states to legalize sports betting after the Supreme Court overturned a federal law that had prohibited most states from allowing sports gambling.<br>In this article we will be looking at a map which displays the current state of affairs when it comes to legalizing sports gambling.</p>
<p>It is important to note that there are a few states which have pending legislation in regards to sports betting and those states are not included on the map.<br>So far Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Michigan have all passed bills to legalize sports betting in their respective states. Iowa has also approved a bill but it has not yet been signed by the Governor.</p>
<p>We will be updating this map as more states pass legislation so be sure to check back for updates!</p>
<h1 id="Which-States-Allow-Sports-Wagering-At-Native-American-Casinos"><a href="#Which-States-Allow-Sports-Wagering-At-Native-American-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="Which States Allow Sports Wagering At Native American Casinos?"></a>Which States Allow Sports Wagering At Native American Casinos?</h1><p>The legality of sports wagering at Native American casinos is a bit of a gray area. There are some states that clearly allow it, while others are not so clear. Let’s take a look at which states allow sports betting at Native American casinos and the laws surrounding it.</p>
<p>In 1992, the United States Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Native American tribe in the case of New Mexico v. The Texas Lottery Commission. This ruling stated that state lotteries could not operate within Native American gambling jurisdictions without the permission of the tribe. This paved the way for sports wagering to be offered at Native American casinos.</p>
<p>Today, there are a number of states that allow some form of sports betting at Native American casinos. These states include: Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Texas and Wisconsin.</p>
<p>There are a few states where the legality is less clear. These states include: Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia and West Virginia. In these cases, it is up to each individual casino to decide whether or not to offer sports betting services.</p>
<p>There are also a few states that have expressly prohibited sports wagering at Native American casinos. These states include: Alabama (except for bingo parlors), Illinois (except for horse racing), Indiana (except for riverboats), Louisiana (except for horseracing), Missouri (except for St. Louis), Nevada and Washington D.C..</p>
<p>So if you’re wondering if you can place a bet on your favorite team while visiting a Native American casino in the US – the answer is yes in most cases! However, be sure to check with the casino beforehand to make sure that they offer this service.</p>
<h1 id="Mississippi-Moves-To-Allow-Sports-Wagering-In-Casinos"><a href="#Mississippi-Moves-To-Allow-Sports-Wagering-In-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="Mississippi Moves To Allow Sports Wagering In Casinos"></a>Mississippi Moves To Allow Sports Wagering In Casinos</h1><p>In a move that could pave the way for widespread legalized sports betting in the United States, Mississippi lawmakers have passed a bill that would allow casinos in the state to offer sports betting. The measure, which was approved by a vote of 99-5 in the state House of Representatives on Tuesday, now heads to the desk of Governor Phil Bryant, who is expected to sign it into law.</p>
<p>The new law would allow casinos in Mississippi to offer bets on professional and college sporting events, as well as horseracing. It would also permit so-called “in-game” betting, which allows bettors to place wagers on outcomes as they happen.</p>
<p>Sports betting is currently legal in just a handful of states, including Nevada and Delaware. But with several other states now considering similar measures, it appears that legalized sports betting may be headed for a nationwide expansion.</p>
<p>Opponents of legalized sports betting argue that it can lead to gambling addiction and other social ills. But supporters say that it can be a valuable source of revenue for states, and that it can also help to spur economic growth.</p>
<p>What do you think? Should sports betting be legalized nationwide?</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Planning-To-Allow-Sports-Wagering-In-Casinos"><a href="#Delaware-Planning-To-Allow-Sports-Wagering-In-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Planning To Allow Sports Wagering In Casinos"></a>Delaware Planning To Allow Sports Wagering In Casinos</h1><p>Delaware is gearing up to allow sports betting in its casinos, something that is sure to please players and add more excitement to the gambling scene. The state’s Gaming Control Board has begun drafting regulations that will govern how sports betting will be conducted, and it is hoped that these will be in place by the fall.</p>
<p>Once the regulations are finalised, Delaware residents will be able to bet on everything from football and basketball to horse racing and golf. The Board is still working out some of the finer details, such as how much money people will be able to wager and what types of bets will be allowed.</p>
<p>There is no word yet on when sports betting will actually start taking place, but officials are hopeful that it will be before the end of the year. In the meantime, those interested in getting a head start can sign up for online accounts with companies like DraftKings and FanDuel.</p>
<p>Delaware was one of the first states to legalise casino gambling, doing so in 1976. Since then, it has become a popular destination for players from all over the country. With sports betting now coming on board, there is no doubt that interest in casino gaming will continue to rise.</p>
